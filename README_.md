## Overall Learning 

During this internship, I learned the basics of digital design using Verilog HDL by working on a practical project. I understood how to design individual RTL modules, use FSM logic to control system flow, and connect all modules into a complete design.

I learned how clock, reset, and pulse synchronization work in real digital systems. I also gained experience in simulation, waveform checking, and synthesis, which helped me verify that the design works correctly.

This internship improved my problem-solving, debugging, and documentation skills. It also helped me understand how real hardware projects are developed and tested in an industry-oriented way.

<!-- Project 1 -->
<h3 id="project1">Project 1: Vending Machine Controller Using Verilog HDL </h3>
<p>
  This project involved designing a Vending Machine Controller using Verilog HDL. The work focused on applying core digital design concepts such as FSM control, modular RTL design, and simulation to implement item selection, currency handling, and dispensing functionality.

## Learnings from LST and SST

<!-- add your experiences over here -->
>
The LST sessions helped me strengthen my technical foundation related to digital design and Verilog, which supported the implementation of my project.
The SST sessions focused on soft skills and professional development. Through these sessions, I learned about critical evaluation of AI, creative problem solving using AI, prompt engineering for productivity, presentation skills, resume preparation, and interview skills. I also gained understanding in leadership, career goal setting, negotiation, and workplace communication.

## **Community Services**

<!-- add descreption in your own words -->

During my internship period, I actively participated in community service activities that focused on social welfare and environmental responsibility. 
These experiences helped me understand the importance of giving back to society and supporting people in need.

### **Activities Involved**
<!-- add the location where you given -->

  
 <!-- add the location where you have panted -->
- **Tree Plantation Drive** – Planted four saplings in my village Kondavelagada,contributing to environmental protection and promoting greenery.

  <!-- add the location where you helped -->
- **Helping Elder Citizens** – Provided food and assistance at an old age home(vizianagaram), supporting elderly people with care and respect during meal distribution. 

<!-- you can write impacts according to your experience in your words-->

### **Impact / Contribution**

- These activities helped me understand the importance of helping others and serving the community.
- I learned to work with people from different backgrounds with patience and responsibility.
- Participating in these services improved my teamwork and communication skills.
- Overall, the experience motivated me to contribute positively to society.
